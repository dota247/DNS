***DNS in laymans terms

*What is reverse DNS in laymans terms
Whenever we navigate to a certain webpage, say google.com, our browser checks for the IP address of that domain name and uses that address to find the correct page.

***DNS, Domain Name System, is an address list of computers connected to the internet. If you want to go to Amazon, you’ll ask DNS where they are located. Just like you would use an address book in normal life (wait a minute, no one actually uses an address book these days, do they?).

Note that an address book only works in a one-dimensional way. It’s easy to find the address of John Smith from your address book but if you are given an address, it’s pretty hard to find out in your address book who lives there - even if you have their address stored somewhere in your address book.

Reverse DNS lookup (rDNS lookup) is exactly this. It’s the act of looking up internet hosts by their IP address. Hence the “reverse” part in the name. It’s the opposite or reverse way of using the internet’s address book, something your old address book can’t even do (try finding out who has the number 955-0455-0922 from a paper address book!)

While the internet overall can seem pretty anarchistic at times, this DNS address book is a stable system that everyone on the internet must agree upon. You can pretty much trust that if DNS says someone is google.com they pretty sure are them (and while this blind trust has led to some significant problems, it’s the best system we’ve got).

Reverse DNS returns hostnames for ip addresses Reverse DNS works the other way around than the usual forward DNS

Now, all internet connected devices have an IP address. The device you are reading this post has one and the computer that hosts this page has one. If they didn’t you couldn’t access this page. You

While not all, a clear majority of all IP addresses have a reverse DNS record. You can check yours with the tool above. So most computers have an entry of our address book. If we know an IP address, we can know who it is, just like you can see with the tool.

When your browser loaded this page, our server was aware of your IP address and your browser was aware of our IP address, thanks to DNS. This is how the internet works.
